# ADC
 a tool for calculating the dimensions of an antenna based on the user-provided frequency and velocity factor
Getting Started
To use the "Antenna Dimensions Calculator" script, follow the steps below:

Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your system.
Clone the repository or download the script file.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Usage
The "Antenna Dimensions Calculator" script requires two inputs from the user: the frequency in MHz and the velocity factor of the transmission medium.

To run the script, execute the following command in the termi
python adc.py
Once the script is running, it will prompt you to enter the frequency in MHz and the velocity factor. Enter the values as requested.

Example:

Enter the frequency in MHz: 100
Enter the velocity factor of the transmission medium: 0.95
The script will then calculate the wavelength, antenna length, and physical length based on the provided inputs.

Example output:

Wavelength: 2997.92 meters
Antenna length: 1498.96 meters
Physical length: 1578.38 meters
The calculated values represent the dimensions of the antenna based on the given frequency and velocity factor.
